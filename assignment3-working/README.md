Repo for assignment 3, working with CSS frameworks

Quite a few of you have expressed some interest in learning how to imlpement a CSS framework into your projects. As we've discussed in the past, there are quite a few different ones to work with.

Twitter Bootstrap and Foundation by Zurb are just two of the many options out there.

The `HTML` document included in this repo is an example using Twitter Bootstrap. Bootstrap is widely used and very much supported by the community. This example includes the CDN links to Bootstrap resources, removing the need for us to have them locally. This takes some of the information overload that is common when first starting out with one of these frameworks.

# Instructions

 - Look around at some of the documentation at http://getbootstrap.com/ or anywhere else on the internet. There's a lot of content out there so this should be very easy.
 - Next, after getting familiar with some of the stuff you cna use from the Bootstrap library, take some of your favorite elements and play around with the markup and the style.
 - You should have at least 5 instances of CUSTOM Bootstrap code.
 - This code can be anything you want to practice with from the Bootstrap library.
 - You do not need to create a whole site, or anything crazy like that.
 - All assets are included in the `HTML` file so you shouldn't need to download anything from Bootstrap

As always, let me know if you have any questions!
